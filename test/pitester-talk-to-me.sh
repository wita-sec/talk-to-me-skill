# WITA Testr Utility for Picroft Skill development  (WHUPI)
# Copyright by Wolf-IT-Architekt

# This scripts tests the talk-to-me skill
# It is supposed to run on a Raspberry Pi with Picroft
# It is called with argument "path to file uterances"
# this file must include uterances that will be directed to Picroft
# the result of these uterances can be monitored with the mycroft-cli-client
# This is kind of "manuel" testing, automation may be the next step.
# How must uterances file look like?

#
#  a line starting with # is a comment and will not be processed
#  a line starting with @ is a comment that will be displayed
#  any other non-empty line line is an uterance that will be directed to Picroft

#
# How to automate testing
# The aim is to save an uterance and its reply as text to a file
# This file later can be evaluated to find bugs/problems
# The layout of that file should be human readable and also m/c readable
#
# We write the uterance to stdout
# We get its reply from the /var/log/mycroft/audio.log file and write to stdout
#    How to get reply from audio.log:
#    cat audio.log | grep Speak: > /tmp/audio_before.log
#    launch Picroft with an uterance
#   cat audio.log | grep Speak: > /tmp/audio_after.log
#   diff /tmp/audio_before.log /tmp/audio_after.log > /tmp/audio_diff.log
#   extract reply text from /tmp/audio_diff.log and write to stdout
#  output can be redirected by the caller to get perstent test results
